## Description

This application uses React to create a component based application that allows users to search by ingredient to find recipes with ingredient lists, instructions and images of the end meal. This was an exercise in utilising react components and pulling from an external API, Edamam. 

## Installation 

This application is easy to install, just clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal.

`npm install`
This will create the node modules folder you will need in order for this application to function correctly.

## Usage
In order to get this application to run you must open up the terminal and enter the following:

`npm start`
The application will then console log the URL in the terminal and React automatically opens the app in your default browser.
